Parallax Laser Range Finder Image Viewer 
========================================

The LRF Image Viewer is an easy-to-use, PC-based graphical interface that 
allows direct and simple control of the [Parallax Laser Range Finder Module][1].
Primary features include:

* Read system/debug messages sent from the LRF
* Send commands to the LRF
* Capture/display/save images from the LRF’s camera (bitmap or raw binary format)
* Enable PC-side image processing functionality (blob detection and identification,
range/distance calculations)

The LRF Image Viewer was designed in Microsoft Visual Basic .NET and requires 
[Microsoft’s .NET Framework Version 2.0 Redistributable Package][2] to be installed 
on the host PC.

The LRF Module connects to the host PC via its serial interface through a USB-to-Serial 
adapter. A [demonstration of the LRF Image Viewer][3] can be found on YouTube.
